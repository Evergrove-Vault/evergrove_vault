**GPT Researcher is an autonomous agent designed for comprehensive web and local research on any given task.**

The agent produces detailed, factual, and unbiased research reports with citations. GPT Researcher provides a full suite of customization options to create tailor made and domain specific research agents. Inspired by the recent [Plan-and-Solve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04091) and [RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401) papers, GPT Researcher addresses misinformation, speed, determinism, and reliability by offering stable performance and increased speed through parallelized agent work
